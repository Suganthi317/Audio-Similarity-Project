# Audio Frequency Comparison and Voice Similarity Evaluation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes and compares two audio recordings to determine how similar they are based on frequency-domain features rather than just pitch.

The system extracts meaningful audio characteristics such as:
- Frequency distribution
- Spectral behavior
- Energy variation

and produces a numerical similarity score.

## 🎯 Objective
- Compare two audio files using signal processing techniques
- Visualize frequency-domain characteristics
- Generate a similarity percentage between the two audio signals
